# Chess

A chess game created with C++ and SDL2 library. I used my "library" called "SDL_GUI" for game menu.
I stopped developing this game because of my High School Entry Exam (LGS).
Still if you want see you can build the project by the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/AlperBayraktar/Chess.git --recursive
cd Chess
cd build
# open build/Makefile and set variables according to comments, then run:
make Build
```
In build/executable, you can see the Chess.exe file.
Make sure that .dll files for SDL2, SDL2_ttf, SDL2_image are in build/executable. Otherwise It won't work.
